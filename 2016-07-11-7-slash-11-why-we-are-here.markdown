"New York makes it clear whether you belong here or not." "Any community you want to be part of, you can find it here." "There's some tunnel vision." "It's like a magnet." "A city constructed as a hierarchy." "New York was a relationship that needed to be managed and required compromise." Why are you here? Your relationship with the city. Open door at 6PM, discussion at 7:45.

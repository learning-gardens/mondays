# Mondays
[mondays.nyc](http://mondays.nyc)

Mondays is a gathering on some Mondays from 7PM onward on the roof of **44 Henry St. 10002**. Each Monday has a theme. Sometimes there is an activity or discussion, but we keep it casual. Mondays are announced here, and in the Learning-Gardens Slack, and also in our Facebook message group. 

If you'd like to join in, feel free to just show up! But there's no buzzer, so better message Toby on Slack or Twitter so we know you're coming.
